# Mini Client Finder (mc-finder)

The purpose of the Mini Client Finder to hightlight the ReactJS foundational knowledge

### Fundamental Concepts:

1. How to create a component 
2. How to "inject" a component to a HTML element
3. How to use props
4. How to use state
5. How does parent / child relationship in ReactJS works
6. Learn the concept of the Virtual DOM

### Lifecycle methods:

1. componentWillUpdate() - executed before the render() method of the component  is called.
2. componentDidUpdate() - executed after the render() method is completed and the new changes to the underlying DOM have been applied
3. componentWillMount() - executed before the node is inserted into the DOM
4. componentDidMount() - after the node is inserted into the DOM
5. componentWillUnmount() - right before the component is removed from the DOM
